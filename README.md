# entertainment.py

This is a sample of a server-side website that displays some of the creator's favorite movies.  This program was
designed for a project on Udacity's Full-stack Web Developer Nanodegree Plus program. **entertainment.py** is a fork
of the repository: _https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode.git_.

# Requirements:
1) **Python 3** found at: _www.python.org_
2) **GitBash**

# Installation

Open GitBash and move to the directory where you want to clone entertainment.py.

Clone the **dpotter** branch in the repository _https://github.com/OmegaAI/ud036_StarterCode.git_.

	$ git clone https://github.com/OmegaAI/ud036_StarterCode.git


# Launch

To launch the website on Windows, open Command Prompt and move to the directory the entertainment.py is located in.  Then enter the
full name of the file.  (Alternative: You can also double-click the file in the directory.)

Upon running the code, an .html file will be created in the same directory and launch the file in your default web browser.
For optimal functionality, you can right-click the .html file in the directory titled "fresh_tomatoes.html".  Use "open with"
and select Google Chrome.  (If you don't have Google Chrome, it's recommended that you download it.)
